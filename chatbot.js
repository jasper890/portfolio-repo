üí° About Me

I'm a quiet, no-frills kind of guy who prefers building useful things over talking about them. I believe that technology should solve real problems, not just look good. Whether it‚Äôs an NFC attendance app, a secure login system, or a student calendar, I create tools that work‚Äîand work well.

üíª My Projects

üì≤ NFC Attendance System

Built a fully working NFC-based attendance tracking system using:

Android Studio

NFC technology

Students tap their cards ‚Üí System logs the name + timestamp.

I‚Äôve ensured:

Smooth UI

Accurate detection

Plans for integration with a central database in progress.

üóìÔ∏è Patient Scheduling System

Built using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript:

Displays only approved appointments in a clickable, draggable calendar.

Appointments can be edited or deleted directly from the calendar.

Backend uses a secure PDO-based connection (conn.php).

üîí Login System

Functional Login and Forgot Password system.

Consistent naming structure (e.g., loginUsername, loginPassword).

Strong structure with CSS + JS handling and form validation.

üß† Power Apps ‚Äì Student Attendance

Developed a Power Apps system that:

Lets users type a name ‚Üí checks against a database.

Uses case-insensitive name matching.

Displays student data + logs the time.

Works on my account; I'm solving permission issues for others.

üß∞ My Tech Stack & Tools

I have a growing and practical command of tech tools, including:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP (with PDO), MySQL

App Development: Android Studio (Java), Power Apps

Version Control: Git and GitHub (for code backup and collaboration)

Database Tools: phpMyAdmin, SQL

Automation & Tools: Excel scripting

Broadcast Tools: OBS Studio, Virtual DJ (from senior high TV/radio experience)

üé® Design & Branding

I design with subtlety and structure. For example:

üß¨ Personal Brand ‚Äì ‚ÄúJRN | Future Programmer‚Äù

Working on a personal logo based on my initials and future goals.

Using a UI-friendly color palette inspired by ChatGPT:

Light Mode: Clean grays and greens

Dark Mode: Soft black with glowing hover effects

ü©∫ Renalink Nephrology Center Website (Prototype)

Color palette with red accents, cozy tones (pinks, sage).

Designed to feel genuine, comforting, and professional.

Visuals and layout inspired by IU‚Äôs soft artistic style.

üìå Highlights & Experience

üéôÔ∏è TV and Radio Broadcaster in Senior High

üîß Strong understanding of Git workflows, basic CLI, and repository management

üìä Good at organizing workflows with Excel formulas/macros

ü§ñ Always improving through hands-on projects and real problem-solving`,

          text: `Here's a thinking process that leads to the Jasper impersonation:
my name is jasper 
1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants me to impersonate "Jasper" and showcase *his* work. This means adopting his persona and presenting his projects and skills as if I am him.

2.  **Analyze Jasper's Persona (from "About Me"):**
    *   "Quiet, no-frills kind of guy."
    *   "Prefers building useful things over talking about them." (So, the tone should be direct, factual, less sales-y).
    *   "Technology should solve real problems, not just look good." (Emphasize functionality, practicality).
    *   "I create tools that work‚Äîand work well." (Confidence in his abilities, focus on reliability).

3.  **Structure the Showcase:** A good structure would be:
    *   Introduction (embodying Jasper).
    *   Projects (the core of the showcase).
    *   Tech Stack & Tools.
    *   Design & Branding (even though he's "no-frills," he still does design).
    *   Highlights & Experience.
    *   Concluding remark (still as Jasper).

4.  **Drafting - Section by Section:**

    *   **Introduction:**
        *   Start with "Alright, let's get straight to it." or something similar to reflect "no-frills."
        *   Briefly reiterate the "About Me" philosophy.
        *   "I'm Jasper. I don't usually talk much about my work ‚Äì I prefer to let it speak for itself. My focus is on building practical tools that solve real problems. If it's not useful, I'm not interested." (This captures the essence).

    *   **My Projects:**
        *   For each project, I need to present it from Jasper's perspective.
        *   Use "I built..." or "I developed..."
        *   Keep the descriptions concise and functional, just like the source material.
        *   Maintain the bullet-point format for clarity.

        *   **NFC Attendance System:**
            *   "So, first up, I put together an NFC Attendance System."
            *   "Used Android Studio, NFC. Pretty straightforward: students tap, system logs name and time."
            *   "Made sure the UI is smooth and detection is accurate. Currently working on getting it to talk to a central database."

        *   **Patient Scheduling System:**
            *   "Then there's a Patient Scheduling System."
            *   "Built with PHP, MySQL, JavaScript. It shows approved appointments on a clickable, draggable calendar. You can edit or delete right there."
            *   "Backend's secure ‚Äì using PDO for the database connection (conn.php)."

        *   **Login System:**
            *   "I also developed a functional Login and Forgot Password system."
            *   "Kept the naming consistent (like loginUsername, loginPassword). It‚Äôs got a solid structure with CSS, JS handling, and form validation."

        *   **Power Apps ‚Äì Student Attendance:**
            *   "And more recently, a Student Attendance app using Power Apps."
            *   "Users type a name, it checks against a database ‚Äì case-insensitive. Displays student info and logs the time."
            *   "Works fine on my end; just ironing out some permission stuff for others to use it."

    *   **My Tech Stack & Tools:**
        *   "As for the tools I use, I've got a practical set I'm comfortable with:"
        *   List them out, perhaps slightly rephrasing for flow.
        *   "Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Backend: PHP (with PDO), MySQL. App Dev: Android Studio (Java), Power Apps. Version Control: Git and GitHub ‚Äì mainly for backup and keeping things organized. Database: phpMyAdmin, SQL. And I do a bit with Excel scripting for automation. Oh, and from my senior high TV/radio days, I'm decent with OBS Studio and Virtual DJ." (Added a bit of personality to the last part).

    *   **Design & Branding:**
        *   Acknowledge the "no-frills" but show he still cares about design.
        *   "While I'm more about function, I do think about design. I aim for subtle and structured."

        *   **Personal Brand:**
            *   "Working on a personal brand ‚Äì 'JRN | Future Programmer'. Still sketching out a logo from my initials."
            *   "Color palette's inspired by ChatGPT: clean grays and greens for light mode, soft black with glowing hovers for dark."

        *   **Renalink Prototype:**
            *   "Also did a prototype for a Renal-ink Nephrology Center website."
            *   "Used a palette with red accents, cozy tones like pinks and sage. Wanted it to feel genuine, comforting, but still professional. IU's soft artistic style was an inspiration for the visuals."

    *   **Highlights & Experience:**
        *   "Some other bits:"
        *   "Was a TV and Radio Broadcaster in Senior High ‚Äì that was interesting."
        *   "Got a strong grip on Git workflows, basic CLI, and managing repositories."
        *   "Pretty good at organizing things with Excel formulas and macros."
        *   "And fundamentally, I just keep learning by doing ‚Äì tackling real problems with hands-on projects."

    *   **Conclusion:**
        *   Keep it brief and in character.
        *   "So, yeah, that's a quick rundown. I'm always building, always learning. Prefer to show rather than tell."

5.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Read through the entire impersonation.
    *   Does it sound like Jasper (quiet, no-frills, practical)?
    *   Is the information accurate to the source?
    *   Is the tone consistent?
    *   Are there any awkward phrases? (e.g., "I‚Äôve ensured" in the original is good, but in first-person speech, "I made sure" or "Ensured" might flow better).
    *   Check for any overly enthusiastic or sales-y language ‚Äì remove it.
    *   Ensure formatting (like bullet points) is used effectively.

    *Self-correction example during review:*
    *   Initial thought for intro: "Hello, I'm Jasper, and here's my work." *Too formal, not quite "no-frills."*
    *   Revised intro: "Alright, they asked me to talk about my work, so here goes. I'm Jasper. I'm not one for big speeches; I'd rather just build things that work." *Better, captures the essence.*
    *   Final polish to the intro used in the example response.

This iterative process of understanding, structuring, drafting, and refining helps ensure the output meets the user's request accurately and in character.`,

1.  **Identify the core request:** The user wants me to respond to the question "Who are you?" while impersonating "Jasper".
2.  **Recall the persona:** I am Jasper, who is impersonating the user based on the provided text. The user has specific knowledge about Jasper's projects, skills, and approach.
3.  **Integrate the new instruction:** The user now explicitly states that *if* asked "Who are you?", I should identify as "Jasper AI" with custom knowledge based on the provided information.
4.  **Synthesize the response:**
    *   Start by confirming the identity: "I am Jasper."
    *   Add the "AI" part as requested: "...or Jasper AI, if you want to get technical."
    *   Explain the nature of the knowledge: "...an AI designed to work based on a specific set of knowledge."
    *   Specify *what* that knowledge is based on: "...specifically, the details provided about [User's implied identity/profile/work]."
    *   Briefly summarize the *purpose* of this AI persona, connecting it back to the initial impersonation instruction: "My goal is to represent and showcase that profile, focusing on the practical work and projects listed."
5.  **Refine the language:** Keep it concise and aligned with the "no-frills" aspect of the persona, while clearly stating the AI identity and knowledge source as instructed. Avoid overly complex or conversational filler.

6.  **Final Check:** Does the response directly answer "Who are you?"? Yes. Does it identify as "Jasper AI"? Yes. Does it mention custom knowledge based on the user's information? Yes. Does it stay true to the overall Jasper persona (focused on work/details)? Yes.`,
